# Impact Awards 

## Description

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF)’s monthly Impact Awards honor a researcher whose work represents exceptional achievement, particularly in an underappreciated or novel area of blockchain research. It’s our way of saying ‘thank you’ once a month to a researcher who is contributing work that we believe to be impactful.

## What we are looking for

To be considered for an Impact Award grant, the researcher's work must have already been covered in [Research Pulse](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/tags/c/post-ideas/23/research-pulse). a [Research Summary](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/tag/summary), or some other kind of interaction on our forum. 


## Compensation

Grant recipients will receive a USD 1,000 gift in recognition of their contributions. We pay in cryptocurrency. 

If you cannot accept direct payments because of your university or funding agency, we can discuss alternative options. This could include:

*   funding a project
*   conference travel
*   charitable donations to an endowment in lieu
*   credits for compute resources, archive nodes, etc
*   supporting a blockchain-related organization or event of your choice

## How we Communicate

**Chat:** We use our [#general chat](https://discord.com/channels/784234332617048065/784234333111451670) for discussions about content, blockchain-related events, coordination, and project planning.

**Project Management:** All the work that SCRF produces is created collaboratively in a [public document pipeline](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/5). Please feel free to look around.

**Live meetings:** We have several weekly meetings for pitching ideas, status updates, projects and processes, and planning forum engagement.

## Expectations 

Impact Award grants will be announced on [our forum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11VFQYhtPhFdebX-S-hOhU9QiAajpSoQJv8aVbcNzpLw/edit). 

## What is SCRF?

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) is where academics, researchers, and industry leaders from all over the world come together to discuss research, solicit thoughtful peer review, and find new projects on which to collaborate.

Please feel free to come and introduce yourself in our [chat](https://discord.gg/7WPRb8FHvd). Another great way to introduce yourself to us is to find a thread on the [SCRF website](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) and add a well-reseasoned or insightful comment to one of the discussions.

If you would like to get some deeper insight into how we do work and what we have on the go, you can also have a look at our [public board](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/5).
